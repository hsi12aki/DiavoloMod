But if this is what you truly need to be happy, Pip, then I understand...$13#$b#So...back to how it was before then, huh? Before I came here. That...'space' between us again. Thought we'd finally closed that gap.$2#$b#It's fine though. Really. Distance has always been our thing. Should've known better than to think I could keep you.$13#$e#You'll...you'll still be around, right, Pip? Of course you will...It's your farm. And Pelican Town's not that big...$13#$b#So, we'll still see each other around. Naturally. Can't really avoid that, can we?$3",
  "Cal.Engaged": "...@. You...you're serious? A mermaid's pendant...from you?$8#$b#...$13#$b#You have...no idea, how many times I've imagined this moment. Played it out in my head a thousand different ways. And none of them...none of them were like this.$13#$b#Remember that silly promise we made as kids? 'Forever and always'. We were just kids playing, I know. But...a part of me always held onto that.$2#$b#Are you sure about this, @? Do you actually want this? With me? Look at me. Look me in the eyes and tell me you understand.$2#$b#...Okay. That's all I needed to hear. Three days. That's all it takes. I'll handle everything, okay?

Why now, @? After all this time, all these years playing this game with you. I was driving myself crazy. Told myself maybe I was reading you all wrong.$2#$b#Felt like I was going to spend the rest of my life just watching you. Second guessing every look, every word, every touch.$13#$b#Forever trapped in your orbit, always one step too far.$13#$b#I was terrified, @. Of moving too quickly and scaring you off. Of ruining everything. I could never bring myself to really cross that line. Not before you.$13#$b#Yoba, it was excruciating...Guess I was the coward all along, huh? Waiting around like some pathetic, lovesick idiot.$2#$b#But you understand what this means, don't you, @...? Now that you're looking at me like that, holding that bouquet. No more games. No more pretending.#$b#We're really doing this now, aren't we? Finally crossing that line. Together.$4",

  "dialogue.purchasedAnimal_Chicken": "You went and got yourself some chickens? Tiny, loud lil' things following you around like you hung the moon?#$b#... Yep, sounds about right. You've got a whole flock of mini-@s now.$1",
  "dialogue.CalebSaloonKey1": "Quick heads up, Pipsqueak. Gus was mentioning he's been wanting to talk to you. Not sure what about, but I told him you'd stop by soon.$10#$b#He's a good guy, so if he's reaching out, it's probably worth your time. Just swing by the Saloon when you get the chance, okay?",

  "Cal.Summit0": "The sky up here feels endless, doesn't it, @? I've seen my fair share from all sorts of altitudes.#$b#Spent half my life chasing that horizon. But none of them compare to this one. Maybe 'cause this one's with you.$4",
  "Cal.Summit1": "When you first got to Pelican Town...did you ever imagine it like this? I'll be honest, I wasn't sure what to expect. Would you be happy to see me? Would you even want me around?$12#$b#I got so used to watching from a distance, being a shadow in the background. Convinced myself I was just a ghost from your past.$2#$b#That this new life you were building was your way of leaving the past, and me, behind...$13#$b#Maybe you didn't need me anymore. And maybe it was better that way.$13",
  "Cal.Summit2": "But I'm a selfish man, @.$4#$b#I saw you here shouldering this whole new world alone. That part of me, that instinct to protect you, was telling me to step in and handle it all for you.#$b#But I watched you work. Watched you set your mind to it and commit to this life. Then I made my choice. To stay close by. Not to impede, but to be your support system.$4",
  "Cal.Summit3": "I still remember that day when I saw you again.$4#$b#You didn't just welcome me back. You made space for me to be apart of your life again. That was when I knew this was exactly where I was meant to be.$4",
  "Cal.Summit4": "You're not the same lil' pipsqueak I grew up with either now, are you, @?#$b#Just look at you...You're incredible. You've etched your mark into this town. Shaped it bit by bit 'til it shined.#$b#You're the pride of this valley. I could never be prouder.$4#$b#Still... You'll always be my little @. The one that I promised to protect. The one who stole my heart all those years ago. The one who still does, every single day.$4",
  "Cal.Summit5": "...To think how close we came to never having this if I hadn't followed that feeling to find you. Two separate lives, two separate skies. The thought alone is unbearable.$2#$b#I'm glad I chose to be selfish. I'm glad I broke a dozen protocols to be here with you. If I had another chance, I would do it all the same. No hesitation.$4",
  "Cal.Summit6": "Now look at us...Inseperable. Every day with you has felt like a gift I don't deserve but can't imagine living without.$4#$b#Being your husband has been the greatest privilege. This life with you is more valuable than any medal, any rank, any commendation the Republic could ever offer.$4",
  "Cal.Summit7": "You poured your heart into this town and the farm. Brought it to life. Nurtured it carefully with your love and care.$4#$b#While you focused on your goals, my job was managing the variables. Clearing the path ahead to make sure nothing ever got in your way.#$b#Sometimes, before you even knew there was a storm on the horizon.$13#$b#Maybe it wasn't my place to. But I couldn't stand the thought of anything impacting you, or your dreams.$2#$b#Everything I've done. My life. My rank. My choices...it was all to keep you safe.#$b#My primary directive has *always* been your safety. My support always a given. A constant for you to rely on. No matter what.$4#$b#And I promise you, no matter where life keeps leading us, I'm forever with you. My course plotted right alongside yours.$4#$b#Where you go, I go. Whatever you do, I'm right behind you. Or maybe even a little ahead at times.$1#$b#There's so much more to come, @. So many more memories to make right here, in our perfect little paradise.$4#$b#This is our 'forever and always' made real. A promise I will continue to renew for you every single year.$4",
  "Cal.Summit8": "So, what's next for the little Pipsqueak who conquerered the valley? Knowing you, you've probably already got a whole list running.$1#$b#Whatever it is, count me in. You know I'll be there every step of the way. Cheering you on. Holding your hand.#$b#No matter how high you fly, you'll always have me as your ground control. Your co-pilot. And your biggest fan.$4#$b#I will always be here to watch your skies.$4",

  "MovieInvite_Caleb002": "You snagged an extra ticket for me? Aw, Pipsqueak! You know I'm never one to say no to you. Of course I'll go with you.$1",
  "MovieInvite_Caleb003": "You're inviting me? Good. Means I don't have to share you with anyone else for a couple hours.",
  "Caleb.moviesprout000": "What's this one about, @? 'A sapling'? Sounds oddly wholesome for us. The poster for it even looks like one of those Saturday morning cartoons you used to watch. Trying to get in touch with your inner child again?",
  "Caleb.moviesprout001": "...$2#$b#Look at the little guy go, being so brave. 'Won't be back for a long time'. Tell me about it, little buddy...$2",
  "Caleb.moviesprout002": "That was...unexpectedly sweet. Hit a little close to home in some parts. But! We still got a happy ending. And a good message, too. We all need some rain to grow, right?#$b#Thanks for dragging me along today, @. I'm glad I got to see that one with you. Definitely deserves the title of the official 'Caleb and @' comfort movie.$1",
  "Caleb.movienatural000": "Oh, the nature documentary! I've been meaning to see this one! I might've seen a fair bit of the world from above, but you don't get to explore everything up close from that high up. Should be some real interesting stuff!#$b#Maybe we'll even get to see some familiar places on the big screen? But if it gets too educational for you, you can always take a nap on me.",
  "Caleb.movienatural001": "Some of those shots were incredible... That bird's eye shot of the Fern Islands almost made me feel like I was right there in the cockpit.#$b#And hey! They didn't make Stardew Valley look half bad, did they? Our patch of green really held its own.$10#$e#You thinking about visiting any of those places, @? Just curious. I'd love to take you to some of those places someday, show you the real thing. Maybe one day.#$b#For now though, it was nice to experience everything from our seats. Thanks again for inviting me, @.",
  "Caleb.movieprairie000": "'Journey of the Prairie King'. Like the game, right? Haven't played it myself, but I've seen some of the others playing the arcade cabinet for it back at the Saloon. Wonder how they'll translate something like that into 'motion film' form.",
  "Caleb.movieprairie001": "Admit it, wasn't that exactly the kind of cheesy chaos you expected? A rock avalanche stopped by...some mud? Seriously. Only in an old Western, I guess. Still fun though, right? No complicated plot lines, no hidden agenda. Just a straightforward story where the good guy wins.$10",
  "Caleb.moviewumbus000": "Is this going to be one of those 'so bad it's good' movies? If it gets you to laugh, I'm in. Could be a good way to switch off the brain for a bit, too.",
  "Caleb.moviewumbus001": "Sooo, moral of the story is even with infinite entertainment, all anyone really wants is to hang out and eat pizza. Did I get that right? Some things are universal, even for space aliens.#$b#...My brain feels...pleasantly empty now. In a good way.$1",
  "Caleb.moviemysterium000": "This looks like the kind of thing that gives kids nightmares for weeks. Are you sure you're up for this, Pipsqueak? I mean, I'll sit through it with you if you insist.$12#$b#If it gets too scary just tug on my arm and I'll cover your eyes.$12",
  "Caleb.moviemysterium001": "...That was less of a movie and more of a Rorschach test.$12#$b#...You okay, @? Gonna need me to check the farmhouse for any...~spooooky~ skeletons tonight?$11",
  "Caleb.moviehowls000": "Since when have you been into horror, @? You know, there's no shame in picking something tamer. Would hate to see my favorite lil' farmer to get too shaken up.$12#$b#But, if you're set on it, I'm game. Hopefully it's not all just cheap jumpscares.#$e#Did you see the poster by the way? 'Based on a true story'...Uh huh. Sure.$12",
  "Caleb.moviehowls001": "Poor guy. That Gary dude needs to work on his situational awareness. These kinds of found footage movies sure do make your mind work to fill in the blanks.$12#$b#...@? You're looking a little pale. Hey, it was just a movie...See? Nothing to worry about when I'm here.$2#$e#...'Thirty miles south of Grampleton'...Grampleton's not too far from us.$12#$b#...Just a movie though, right?$11",
  "Caleb.moviecoldstar000": "Yeeep. It's that time of the year! You used to love all of these cheesy Winter Star movies when you were a kid!$1",
  "Caleb.moviecoldstar001": "Been years since I saw that one! Didn't they make a book out of it, too? I swear I had a Coldstar Ranch picture book when we were kids.#$b#Feeling some of that holiday cheer now, @? Personally, I'm feeling kind of inspired now...How about we do a little Winter Star movie marathon together sometime?$10#$b#Complete with hot cocoa and fuzzy socks.$1",
  "Caleb.moviezuzu000": "This is the one you wanted to see, @? Pretty sure this movie's older than you are, Pipsqueak.#$b#...And me.$12#$b#...And probably even Gramps.$8#$b#Film buffs call it one of the classics, though. Guess we'll find out what makes it so iconic. Go ahead, lead the way, @.",
  "Caleb.moviezuzu001": "Did...did we miss something? Was there a secret ending we missed? Was the conflict between 'reason' and 'emotion' resolved by...the credits rolling? No, but seriously. No ending? What was the point?$9#$b#At least I got to spend two hours sitting next to you. That's still a win in my book.",

  "Honey.onekid_Caleb_1_NN": "They already got you wrapped around their tiny finger, don't they? Just like how you wrapped me around yours all those years ago.$4#$e#Generational charm, we could call it. It's in your DNA.$11",
  "Honey.onekid_Caleb_2_NN": "Little gremlin kept me up all night. But...one look at that face. Worth it.$4",
  "Honey.onekid_Caleb_3_NN": "I've been calling %kid1 'Little Pipsqueak' when you're not around. Is this going to be confusing?$12",
  "Honey.onekid_Caleb_4_NN": "%kid1 was extra fussy today, so I put them up in the air and let them pretend they could fly. You should've seen them, honey...eyes wide as saucers, little giggles...I can't wait to show them the real thing. Just...not yet. Not for a long time.",
  "Honey.onekid_Caleb_5_NN": "Whenever you're not around they just start babbling away. I think they miss their mom.$4",
  "Honey.onekid_Caleb_6_NN": "They're just like you when you were little. I'd better armor-plate my heart now, shouldn't I? Two of you will be the death of me.",
  "Honey.onekid_Caleb_7_NN": "%kid1 already figured out how to get extra dessert by giving me puppy-dog eyes. History repeating itself, honey.",
  "Honey.onekid_Caleb_8_NN": "Made %kid1 a paper plane earlier. You know... like the ones I used to make for you. The way their eyes lit up, honey...They were completely captivated, lost in its little flight path. Reminded me a lot of someone.$4",
  "Honey.onekid_Caleb_9_NN": "%kid1 sleeps just like you did as a baby. Arms and legs everywhere like a little starfish. Except...somehow even cuter, if that's possible.$4",
  "Honey.onekid_Caleb_10_NN": "Took %kid1 for a walk with me around the farm today. Pointed out the crops and chickens.#$b#Think they more interested in chewing on my finger...$1",
  "Honey.onekid_Caleb_11_NN": "Honey, you won't believe what I saw...We went down for nap time earlier and when I woke up %kid1 was using my old Aviation Administration jacket as a blanket.$4#$b#Didn't have the heart to move 'em. How could I win against those sleepy eyes?$4",
  "Honey.onekid_Caleb_12_NN": "Remember how Gramps used to bounce us on his knee? Been trying it with %kid1...feels strange. Like stepping into his shoes. Big shoes to fill...but I can manage. For them.$4",
  "Honey.twokids_Caleb_0_NN": "Okay, honey. We're *officially* running zone defense now. Man to man coverage just isn't cutting it with these two moving targets.$12#$b#...Tactical retreat to the kitchen for coffee?$1",
  "Honey.twokids_Caleb_1_NN": "Spent 10 minutes this morning doing negotiations with %kid1 over sharing their toys with %kid2. Felt more intense than some of the Republic briefings I've sat through.#$b#...Fatherhood is a different kind of battlefield, huh?$12",
  "Honey.twokids_Caleb_2_NN": "%kid1 keeps trying to commandeer %kid2's toy. Does that...remind you of anyone?#$b#Older sibling instincts are strong, honey. Guess it's my job now to mediate these territorial disputes.",
  "Honey.twokids_Caleb_3_NN": "Two sets of tiny footsteps running around the farm now. Valley better watch out.",
  "Honey.twokids_Caleb_4_NN": "Maybe one day they'll both be flying. Little pilots of their own. Imagine, both of them soaring through the sky. We're building a whole family fleet.",
  "Honey.twokids_Caleb_5_NN": "Maybe it's just me...but, do you ever feel like you're...outnumbered, honey? Suddenly surrounded by tiny, demanding, but adorable forces? Don't worry. Reinforcements have arrived.",
  "Honey.twokids_Caleb_6_NN": "%kid1 finally figured out that between the two of them, the kids can reach the snack stash in the upper kitchen drawer.$0#$e#Remind you of anyone, pipsqueak?$1",
  "Honey.twokids_Caleb_7_NN": "Caught *both* of them trying to 'fly' off the couch today. I don't even know where %kid2 learned to do that from, I guess just trying to copy %kid1?$12#$b#Seriously, it nearly gave me a heart attack...I had to barter with them and I ended up tossing 'em in the air instead.$1",
  "Honey.twokids_Caleb_8_NN": "Their giggles are just like yours, @. Bright, like pure sunshine. It's infectious. It's...the best sound in the world. Fills the whole house up with light. All of you do.$4",
  //Patio and Spouse Area
  "Honey.Outdoor_0_NN": "Think we have room on the farm to build a hangar? Asking for a friend, of course.$11",
  "Honey.Outdoor_1_NN": "Seeing the farm come back to life like this, it's almost like Gramps is still here, isn't it? You're doing him proud, honey. You're doing us both proud.",
  "Honey.Outdoor_2_NN": "You know, I've been thinking about the security around here. Just making sure everything's...safe. For you.",
  "Honey.Outdoor_3_NN": "Don't forget Pierre said a fertilizer shipment was coming in. Wanna go pick it up together? Or do you think you can handle it yourself?#$b#You know how he gets all flustered when I speak to him.$1",
  "Honey.Outdoor_4_NN": "@? Good morning, honey. Thought I'd let you sleep in a bit while I watched the sunrise. I got your coffee ready, too.#$action AddItem (O)395",
  "Honey.Outdoor_5_NN": "Fences been giving you any trouble, honey? Wish you'd ask me for help, I'd hate for you to end up with splinters...$2",
  "Honey.Outdoor_6_NN": "Hm? What's wrong? I'm just supervising.",
  "Honey.Outdoor_7_NN": "Need me to fetch you some iced tea, your majesty? Colonel Caleb, at your service.",
  "Honey.Outdoor_8_NN": "Y'know, technically, I outrank you. But here? On this farm? I'm pretty sure I'm just your glorified assistant.",
  "Honey.Outdoor_9_NN": "Fresh air, sunshine...Could almost forget there's a whole world beyond this valley. Almost.",
  "Honey.Outdoor_10_NN": "The chickens are giving me the side eye...$5",
  "Honey.Outdoor_11_NN": "You fit right in here, you know? On the farm. Out here, in the sun. It just looks...right. Like you were always meant to be here, right here. With me.",
  "Honey.Outdoor_12_NN": "Morning, @. Just checking up on my herb pot.#$e#It's real convenient always having fresh herbs on hand without having to rely on constantly going out to buy them.#$b#Guess your lil' green thumb rubbed off on me.$1",
  //Work and Errands
  "Honey.workLeave_Caleb_0_NN": "Honey? Look, I have to go. Duty calls... But remember, you're mine, alright? This farm, this town, this valley...all under my protection.#$b#You're safe here. Just wait for me to get back.",
  "Honey.workLeave_Caleb_1_NN": "Need anything from Zuzu City, honey? I've got a booked schedule today, but if there's anything you need I'll make the time for it.",
  "Honey.workLeave_Caleb_2_NN": "Got an emergency call...Need to deal with some things in Zuzu today. Stay vigilant here, okay? Have a good day, honey. I'll be thinking of you.",
  "Honey.workLeave_Caleb_3_NN": "@? I'm about to head out. I'll be back before you know it. And if anything happens...if you need anything, you know how to reach me. Right?#$b#My comms channel is always open for you.",
  "Honey.workLeave_Caleb_4_NN": "I'll be home late tonight again, but I'll be back before midnight. Promise me you won't stay up waiting?$2#$b#I'll bring you back something nice from Zuzu, alright? Only if you're really good.$6",
  "Honey.workLeave_Caleb_5_NN": "You're up...? Honey, I'm sorry, did I wake you while getting ready...?$2#$e#I'm just about to head out but I have some breakfast on the counter for you and prepped your thermos, it's in the fridge.#$b#Just wanna make sure you're set for the day. I love you, honey. I'll be the first thing you see when you open your eyes tomorrow.$4",
  "Honey.workReturn_Caleb_0_NN": "I flew over Zuzu city today. Did you want me to take you next time? We could make it a day. I'd love to have you by my side for once while I work.$4",
  "Honey.workReturn_Caleb_1_NN": "Day was...productive. Took care of some things. Don't worry your pretty little head about it, okay?",
  "Honey.workReturn_Caleb_2_NN": "Kept you waiting again...? I'm sorry, honey....Duty calls, even here in paradise.#$b#Just know coming back to you is the mission I always prioritize.$2",
  "Honey.workReturn_Caleb_3_NN": "Don't...don't ever doubt if I'll come back, alright? No matter where I go, no matter how long. This...this is my true north. You'll always pulls me home.$4",
  "Honey.workReturn_Caleb_4_NN": "Honey...Sorry I'm so late. Things ran longer than expected. But...home now. Finally.",
  "Honey.workReturn_Caleb_5_NN": "@...You're still up?#$b#...Yeah, a late one. Again. Just glad to be back home. With you. Just... really need to see you, even for a minute, before lights out.$2",
  "Honey.errandsLeave_Caleb_0_NN": "Heading out for some errands, @. Need anything specific?",
  "Honey.errandsLeave_Caleb_1_NN": "Early supply run into town today. Gotta pick up some groceries, maybe check out Pierre's stock, and...maybe some extra goodies since you've been working so hard.$7",
  "Honey.errandsLeave_Caleb_2_NN": "Alrighty, honey, heading to Pierre's for the weekly stock up. Need anything? Keep the doors locked, and stay close to the farm.#$b#Comms are on if anything comes up. I'll be back in the evening. Love you.",
  "Honey.errandsLeave_Caleb_3_NN": "Gotta go pick up some supplies today. Don't even worry about it, honey. I've got the list handled. You just keep focus on things here, alright? Don't wander too far from the property. Stay safe.",
  "Honey.errandsLeave_Caleb_4_NN": "Mornin', honey. Gotta head into town, need to restock a few things and do a grocery run. You stay put, yeah? Everything you possibly need is here. I'll be back before you know it.",

  "Honey.errandsReturn_Caleb_0_NN": "Everything alright here? No...incidents while I was out? Got everything we needed.",
  "Honey.errandsReturn_Caleb_1_NN": "I'm back, honey. Missed you...badly. Feels good to be home. This farmhouse...it's where I need to be. How was your evening?$4",
  "Honey.errandsReturn_Caleb_2_NN": "Evenings feel like they're getting darker now, huh? Just got back. Town was...noisy. Tired... but glad to be home.$4",
  "Honey.errandsReturn_Caleb_3_NN": "Colonel Caleb, reporting back to base. Mission accomplished. Well, mostly.#$b#Everything still standing? House in one piece? Were you...behaving yourself while I was gone, honey?$6",
  "Honey.errandsReturn_Caleb_4_NN": "Hey, I'm back. You okay, honey? Everything quiet here? Didn't miss me too much, did you? Just glad to be back. Was hard to not think about you whole time I was gone.",
  "Honey.errandsReturn_Caleb_5_NN": "Resupply mission: Successful. All quiet on the home front, honey? How are you holding up?",
  //Relationship Strength
  "Honey.Good_0_NN": "@...?#$e# Heh. You keep tilting your head when you listen to me, like a puppy. It's cute.$6#$e#...What do you mean I do the same thing?$8",
  "Honey.Good_1_NN": "Leaving...? To go...where? Don't you know you're home now, with me?$9",
  "Honey.Good_2_NN": "Sometimes I'll catch you out there, knees deep in the dirt, sleeves rolled up, and I just... watch.#$b#For a second, I swear I see 7 year old you, tending your pretend garden with that plastic trowel Gramps bought you. Me, 'supervising' from the porch till you started bossing me around.$4#$e#Some things never change. Except now, I actually like taking orders from you.$11",
  "Honey.Good_3_NN": "Saw the grocery list you left on the fridge. 'Snacks!' and 'Braised chicken wings!!' circled three times...Very subtle.$1",
  "Honey.Good_4_NN": "Still just calling me 'Caleb' even though we're married, huh? You sure are straight to the point... Gotta respect that.#$b#Plus, means when you do slip up and call me 'sweetie' or 'baby', I'll know you really mean it. ...No pressure, Honey.$6",
  "Honey.Good_5_NN": "Yoba, honey. You're gorgeous. ...And also dead on your feet. So, coffee first, lunch second, or do I just carry you to the couch now and let you nap on me. Your orders, Captain?",
  "Honey.Good_6_NN": "Name your crisis, Captain @. Hungry? I'll cook. Crows invading? I'll declare war. Just try handling everything alone, see how fast I intervene.",
  "Honey.Good_7_NN": "You're my responsibility. Always have been, always will be. And I don't mind it. Not one bit.",
  "Honey.Good_8_NN": "Wanna sit on the porch for a bit? Just...talk? Or not talk, I'm perfectly capable of keeping my mouth shut for a while. Whatever you need.",
  "Honey.Good_9_NN": "You're distracting me...Do it again.$6",
  "Honey.Good_10_NN": "Marriage is a team effort, honey. And as your partner, I reserve the right to spoil you rotten.$11",
  "Honey.Good_11_NN": "Penny for your thoughts? Or...maybe just a kiss? I hear those are good for chasing away the blues.$7",
  "Honey.Good_12_NN": "Guess there really is no hiding it anymore, huh? You've got me wrapped around your little finger. Always have.$4",
  "Honey.Good_13_NN": "You look like you need a hug. C'mere. No arguments. Just accept your fate.",
  "Honey.Good_14_NN": "...Soft. Still got those chubby little cheeks, huh? ...Hey, don't look at me like that. I'm just confirming important data.",
  "Honey.Neutral_0_NN": "You're still my @, married or not. Just means I've got a lifetime together with you to tease you now.$1",
  "Honey.Neutral_1_NN": "Of course I still have that model plane you gifted me before I left for the flight academy! It's a prized possession at this point.$1",
  "Honey.Neutral_2_NN": "Everything I do. Everything I am... it's for you. Whether you realize it or not. Whether you want it or not.$13",
  "Honey.Neutral_3_NN": "You know I'm not going anywhere, right honey? Still your Caleb. Still here for you. Always.",
  "Honey.Neutral_4_NN": "Hm? And where do you think you're going, huh? We live together, you know. That means you owe me my daily quota of attention.",
  "Honey.Neutral_5_NN": "Laundry day, honey. Yours, mine, and the mountain of muddy jeans you somehow accumulated. I swear, you attract dirt like a magnet.$12",
  "Honey.Neutral_6_NN": "You always ask what I'm thinking. Sometimes, honey, you don't wanna know. But if eases your worries...most of the time, it's about you.$4",
  "Honey.Neutral_7_NN": "Go on and get ready, honey. I'll have coffee waiting by the time you're done. Black for me, creamy and sweet for you. I remembered.$11",
  "Honey.Neutral_8_NN": "I was thinking...we could try that new recipe from Zuzu City Magazine for dan dan noodles. Or we could just order a pizza and throw on some old movies. Your call, Captain.",
  "Honey.Neutral_9_NN": "Whenever I get the free time I'm thinking of sprucin' up the farmhouse. Hang up some pictures, get some new rugs from Pierre's. Changes up the scenery a bit.",
  "Honey.Bad_0_NN": "I'm doing too much...? Maybe you're right. Maybe I am too much. But you don't understand what it's like to lose everything. To stare into the abyss and barely crawl back.$5#$b#The thought of losing you...after everything I've seen...it terrifies me. So forgive me for wanting to hold on too tight. Is it that wrong?$13",
  "Honey.Bad_1_NN": "I went to see Harvey. He said... I need to work on my 'attachment issues'.$5",
  "Honey.Bad_2_NN": "You were out late again, weren't you...? If you keep this up, I'm gonna start showing up with a flashlight and dragging you home myself.$5",
  "Honey.Bad_3_NN": "If you found out I wasn't who you thought I was, what would you do?$13",
  "Honey.Bad_4_NN": "Sometimes I think I should have stayed away. You were better off without me. Safer.$13",
  "Honey.Bad_5_NN": "Why do you keep pushing me?$9#$e#I tell you to be careful, you go deeper into the mines. I tell you not everyone is trustworthy, you run around town wanting to be everyone's friend. I tell you to stay away from Joja, you...$9#$b#Don't you understand? I'm trying to protect you!$5",
  "Honey.Bad_6_NN": "Another nightmare. The usual. Falling, failing... losing you. Just... stay close, okay? Makes it easier to... breathe.$13",
  "Honey.Bad_7_NN": "...You should come home early tonight. It's dangerous out there at night. More than you know.$5#$b#And...I miss you.$13",
  "Honey.Bad_8_NN": "I'm watching you, honey. Always.$3",
  "Honey.Bad_9_NN": "...Where are you headed today? Maybe I should tag along.$5"
